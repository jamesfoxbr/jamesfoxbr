## 🚀 About Me:
Hi, I'm James, a digital artist from Brazil currently on a self-taught journey to become a game developer.

I've always been fascinated by video games and curious about the programming behind them. It wasn't until adulthood that I decided to commit to learning programming on my own. My journey began with Lua on Pico-8, where I experimented with creating simple prototypes and understanding the fundamentals of game development. Later, I explored the Godot Engine, which provided valuable insights into game mechanics and design.

However, I discovered that working within a general-purpose game engine didn’t align with my interests. I prefer coding games directly, without relying on the extensive panels and tools of game engines. This hands-on approach allows me to gain a deeper understanding of programming and a closer connection to the development process.

After working with Godot, I decided to focus on learning C++ to develop games entirely from scratch. This approach allows me to create games without relying on general-purpose game engines, giving me full control over the development process and a deeper understanding of the underlying systems.

## 🌱 Currently Learning:
- 📚 **C++ Programming**: My current focus is on designing and developing games by building every component directly in code. I find this approach more intuitive and enjoyable compared to using general-purpose game engines like Godot or Unity. It allows me to have complete control over the development process and gain a deeper understanding of the underlying programming concepts.
- 🎨 **Graphics Programming in OpenGL and Shaders**: Exploring the depths of rendering technology and mastering the art of creating visuals from the ground up, I’m focused on building a solid foundation to bring immersive graphics to life through code. This journey is teaching me to understand the intricate processes that transform data into stunning visual experiences.
- 🧠 **Assembly 6502**: Delving into the art of retro gaming code to learn from the brilliant minds of the past. By studying their techniques, I'm uncovering timeless principles and gaining a deeper appreciation for the foundations of programming.
