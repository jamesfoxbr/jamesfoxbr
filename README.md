# Hi there! 👋 Welcome to my GitHub profile!

🎮 **Aspiring Game Developer | Self-Taught Programmer | Passionate Learner | Digital Artist**

## 🚀 About Me:
Hi, I'm James, a digital artist from Brazil currently on a self-taught journey to become a game developer.

I've always been fascinated by video games and curious about the programming behind them. It wasn't until adulthood that I decided to commit to learning programming on my own. My journey began with Lua on Pico-8, where I experimented with creating simple prototypes and understanding the fundamentals of game development. Later, I explored the Godot Engine, which provided valuable insights into game mechanics and design.

However, I discovered that working within a general-purpose game engine didn’t align with my interests. I prefer coding games directly, without relying on the extensive panels and tools of game engines. This hands-on approach allows me to gain a deeper understanding of programming and a closer connection to the development process.

## 💡 Skills & Interests:
- 🎮 **Game Development**: Pico-8, Godot, and writing code-powered games from scratch.
- 💻 **Programming**: Learning C++ and discovering new ways to solve challenges.
- 🎨 **Digital Art & Pixel Art**: Crafting captivating visuals and nostalgic pixel art pieces that bring characters and worlds to life.
- 🔧 **Creative Problem Solving**: Enjoy tackling coding puzzles and turning ideas into reality.

## 🌱 Currently Learning:
- 📚 **C++ Programming**: My current focus is on developing games and learning how to create every piece of the puzzle to build games from scratch directly in code because I feel more confortable than using general purpose game engines like Godot, Unity, etc.
- 🎨 **Graphics Programming in OpenGL**: Diving into the world of rendering and learning how to bring visuals to life from the ground up.
- 🧠 **Assembly 6502**: Delving into the art of retro gaming code to learn from the brilliant minds of the past. By studying their techniques, I'm uncovering timeless principles and gaining a deeper appreciation for the foundations of programming.
