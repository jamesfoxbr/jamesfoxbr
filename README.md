## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm trying to self-learn how to program to make games in the future. I started making some simple prototypes games on Pico-8 (a fantasy console), after this I jumped and started to learn Godot and now I'm learning programming using C++ because I like make games without using general purpose game engine and like to make all stuff direct in code. I think I learn more about computers and programming this way.

- I'm currently learning about graphics programming in OpenGL because I'm too curious.
