## 🚀 About Me:
Hi, I'm James, a digital artist from Brazil currently on a self-taught journey to maybe become a game developer someday.

I've always been fascinated by video games and curious about the programming behind them. It wasn't until adulthood that I decided to commit to learning programming on my own. I strted to learn how to program with Lua on Pico-8, where I experimented with creating simple prototypes and understanding the fundamentals of game development. Later, I explored the Godot Engine for some time making more game prototypes and experiments.

However, I discovered that working within a general-purpose game engine is not my cup of tea. I prefer coding games directly, without relying on the extensive panels and tools of game engines. I find more intuitive make stuff I need direct in code. This don't mean I make everything from scratch, I still use programming libraries and framaworks to help me.

After working with Godot, I decided to focus on learning C++ to develop games. This approach allows me to create games without relying on general-purpose game engines, giving me full control over the development process.
