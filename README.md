# Hi there! 👋 Welcome to my GitHub profile!

🎮 **Aspiring Game Developer | Self-Taught Programmer | Passionate Learner**

---

## 🚀 About Me:
Hey there! I'm James a digital artist on an exciting journey of self-learning to become a game developer, one line of code at a time. My passion for creating games started with experimenting on **Pico-8** (a super cool fantasy console), where I crafted simple game prototypes. From there, I leveled up to learning **Godot**, which expanded my understanding of game mechanics and design.

But that wasn’t enough—I craved a deeper connection to the art of programming! Now, I’m diving into the world of **C++ programming**, where I explore how to build games from scratch without relying on general-purpose game engines. By going straight into the code, I feel like I'm truly mastering the magic behind computers and programming.

## 💡 Skills & Interests:
- 🎮 **Game Development**: Pico-8, Godot, and writing code-powered games from scratch.
- 💻 **Programming**: Learning C++ and discovering new ways to solve challenges.
- 🔧 **Creative Problem Solving**: Enjoy tackling coding puzzles and turning ideas into reality.

---

## 🌱 Currently Learning:
- 📚 **C++ Programming**: My current focus is on developing games and learning how to create every piece of the puzzle to build games from scratch directly in code because I feel more confortable than using general purpose game engines like Godot, Unity, etc.
- 🎨 **Graphics Programming in OpenGL**: Diving into the world of rendering and learning how to bring visuals to life from the ground up.
- 🧠 **Assembly 6502**: Delving into the art of retro gaming code to learn from the brilliant minds of the past. By studying their techniques, I'm uncovering timeless principles and gaining a deeper appreciation for the foundations of programming.
